User interaction building blocks for React

## Overview

This library defines simple building blocks for coding complex interactions.

Approach:

- declarative, JSX-oriented
- some assembly effort required
- extra care to avoid timing bugs
- composition using [function-as-child](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9) technique

Core areas:

- DOM interaction affordances
    - `Focusable`: track DOM focus state for an element and all of its children
    - `Hoverable`: track DOM mouse hover status
    - `Movable`: track mouse and touch movement for gestures and dragging
    - `Pressable`: track mouse click and touch status for gestures and dragging
- abstract interaction state
    - `Data`: request data on demand and asynchronously wait for result
    - `Op`: trigger long-running action and report its results to the user
    - `Task`: status tracker started and stopped via user events (for e.g. dropdowns, popups)
    - `Timeout`: basic timeout state triggered via prop

## Op Usage

Simple usage example of the `Op` component:

```
<Op
    action={() => doSomethingReturningPromise()}
    then={result => doSomethingElseUnlessAlreadyUnmounted(result)}
>
    {(currentOp, lastOp) =>
        <form onSubmit={() => currentOp.invoke()} action="javascript:void(0)">
            {lastOp && lastOp.isError
                ? <var>Please try again! Error: {lastOp.value}</var>
                : null
            }

            {currentOp.isPending ? <Spinner/> : null}

            ... input elements, etc ...

            <button type="submit" disabled={currentOp.isPending}>Submit</button>
        </form>
    }
</Op>
```
